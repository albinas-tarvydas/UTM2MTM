## About the author

Albinas Tarvydas was an Ontario Land Surveyor from 1952 to 1988. Owing to his mathematical talents, he was given the opportunity by his employer to write surveying software for their Burroughs mainframe. It was certainly an exciting and unique opportunity, at a time when computing was not the ubiquotos thing it is today. Albinas often reflected fondly on that time as one of the highlights of his long and proud career. He carried his passion for surveying, computing, and mathematics forward into his retirement. These programs were written by Albinas during his retirement and are a testament to that passion and enthusiasm, something he wished to share with all those around him.
